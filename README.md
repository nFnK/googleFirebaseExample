eaglejs - Simple Google Firebase Example

==================

This is to demonstrate how to show data and change the data in real time using javascript in a firebase database. Try
opening this up in multiple browsers and watch each one get updated at the same time. :) Firebase is really powerful and is great
for many applications.

I added a second example where one can toggle an alarm on from anywhere, and all parties can hear it go off.

This uses an example database on my firebase account. Contact me if you have any questions.
